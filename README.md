# Hurricane-Vision

Currently a project to use the HURSAT-AVHRR dataset to attempt to predict the strength of hurricanes using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. 

Current Plan:

Create scripts to rename files to a more managable name. 
Research ways to pipeline files through main plotting script and store images for later use.
Find a way to automatically tag each image with the strength of the hurricane at the time of image.
Use ML and CV to predict the category of the hurricane. This way it will be more accurate.
