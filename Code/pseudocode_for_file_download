# Pseudocode to download all files from NOAA dataset

for year_dir in range(1978,2010):
  iterate through each years directory and download each link to single location

for each_file in single_location:
  double uncompress each file
  get all .nc files out of the folders made and delete the remaining stuff
  rename each of these .nc files using file_renamer
  store .nc files in database by year
